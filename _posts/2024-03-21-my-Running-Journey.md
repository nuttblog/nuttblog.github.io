My running journey didn't start with anything flashy.

It began on a gym treadmill, watching the person next to me run steadily for half an hour while I could barely clock two or three minutes. Even my wife, who started exercising at the same time, managed to hit 5K on that treadmill long before I did.

The transition from someone who never ran to becoming "a runner" is, in my opinion, the hardest step. At first, the moment I heard the word "run," I’d instinctively try to sprint as fast as my legs could carry me. Of course, when you take someone who doesn't exercise and force them to sprint, they’ll want to quit on day one. I remember secretly telling myself, *"Maybe this just isn't for me."*

It wasn't until I started seriously studying how to run that I realized I had been clueless all along.

Running is like any other skill: you have to start from easy to hard, from slow to fast. If you can’t run fast for long, then just run slow! By building up my stamina through slow runs, I eventually began running longer and longer until I hit my first milestone: the 5K.

### The Logic of "Zone 2"

Later on, I discovered something called **Zone 2 Training**. It’s a cardio method that focuses on using fat as the primary fuel source. The principle is simple: run at a low heart rate (roughly 60-70% of your maximum heart rate) so that you feel comfortable, breathe easily, and can hold a conversation.

Every runner has a different Zone 2. Some people are so fit that they can run quite fast while keeping their heart rate in this zone. For me, I do incorporate some speed work, but since I live with chronic hepatitis, pushing my body to the absolute limit isn't always the wisest choice.

After passing the 5K mark, I remember the 10K milestone arrived much sooner than expected. Naturally, once you enter the "running circle," everything else follows: running groups, race events, gear, and eventually, the ambition to conquer a marathon.

One lesson I’ve learned from running is that it’s actually a very straightforward sport. If you want to enter a race at a certain distance, you just train for that distance. It’s like preparing for an exam; if you’ve done the work, you won't feel nervous when you hit the field.

My goal in any race isn't to compete with anyone else—it's to compete with myself. The toughest enemy on my path is my own laziness. I truly admire people who can wake up at 4:00 or 5:00 AM to run consistently for years, because I know exactly how hard that is.

I have a hundred excuses ready to keep me in bed: 
* *"I ran a lot yesterday"*
* *"I need a rest day (even if the previous run wasn't that hard)"*
* *"I feel tired, I didn't sleep well"*

Signing up for a race is the only tool that effectively kills those excuses.

### The Wall at 35K (or 27K)

Training for a Half Marathon (21.1 km) isn't too complicated. Sometimes training up to 15 km is enough, and on race day, the atmosphere and the energy of the crowd will pull you across the finish line.

But a **42.195 km Marathon** is a different beast. Even sitting on a motorcycle for that distance is exhausting. Training for a marathon is about more than just running; it’s about nutrition plans—what to eat before and during the run. For those with full-time jobs, it means carving out time every morning and evening to hit the necessary mileage.

I’m fortunate that my work schedule is flexible, so planning a 35 km training run isn't the issue. The real challenge is actually finishing it.

Many people talk about the **"Mile 35 Devil"**—the physical and mental wall runners hit when their glycogen stores are empty and the brain starts screaming, *"I can't do this anymore,"* urging you to quit.

I didn't have that problem—because my devil showed up much earlier, around the 27 km mark. No matter how much I trained, it felt like my tank hit empty right there every single time.

### My Only Rule

Some runners have a "Golden Rule" about never walking during a race. If they can’t run, they’ll stop to stretch and then keep going. I only have one rule: **Reach the finish line before the cut-off time.**

My philosophy is that if I’m not fast enough to win a trophy, then running for my health is enough. I have no interest in constantly obsessing over breaking my own Personal Best (PB).

Ultimately, completing two marathons without injury is a massive success for me—especially considering I started by barely managing 200 meters.

Every runner's path is unique. I believe that once you’ve completed a marathon, your life changes. The "new you" who has covered 42.195 km knows the value of discipline, self-grit, and perseverance.

My goal from now on isn't about entering more races, increasing distance, or chasing times. It’s simply to keep running consistently until I’m 70 or 80 years old, just like the many veteran runners out there. If I can do that, I’ll be happy. 🙂
