In Paulo Coelho’s *The Alchemist*, there is a recurring mention of **"Beginner’s Luck."** It is that mysterious force that favors those starting a new journey. Whether entering a new job or launching a business, we often see newcomers outperform veterans. 

Is it just a fluke? Sometimes. But in the professional world, "Beginner’s Luck" is often driven by specific psychological advantages:

### 1. Raw excitement and lack of bias
Newcomers are fueled by fire. Because they haven't been told "that’s impossible" yet, they aren't confined by the mental boxes or "best practices" that often limit experienced professionals.

### 2. The luxury of low expectations
When you start a new sales role, for example, the company often expects very little initially. This lack of pressure allows you to work with a relaxed mind. Paradoxically, being relaxed often leads to better decision-making and higher performance than being stressed by high targets.

### 3. The "Fresh Eyes" Effect 
A beginner views everything with openness. This "Beginner’s Mindset" allows for a higher level of creativity. They see the "obvious" problems that those who have been there for years have become blind to—the proverbial "Hidden in plain sight"

### The Culture Trap
From my experience, the danger starts once a newcomer has been in the system for a while. They begin to be swallowed by the existing corporate culture. 

This is why **protecting the work environment** is critical. Maintaining a healthy atmosphere and removing toxic behaviors is not just about HR—it’s about preserving that "Fresh Eyes" energy.

To stay competitive, we must consciously try to view our business through the eyes of a beginner. Seeking opinions from "outsiders" isn't a sign of weakness; it’s a strategy to uncover solutions that are hidden in plain sight.

**Stay hungry, stay foolish, and always keep your beginner’s luck alive.**
