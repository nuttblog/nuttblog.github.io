I’m currently migrating about 200 posts from an old blog on WordPress.com. My digital history goes back much further, though; 15 years ago, I was self-hosting around 10 different blogs. Some were passion projects, but others were built purely for AdSense. Over time, I let them go one by one, though I still maintain two business sites on WordPress today.

I’ve spent years documenting ideas and lessons on my personal blog. There is a specific sense of contentment I feel when I'm in the "flow" of writing—I think that’s the main reason I keep doing this.

### The Domain Habit
I have a confession: I used to have a "dirty habit" of hoarding domain names. It was addictive to fantasize about owning digital assets that someone might pay a fortune for one day. I did sell a few, but never for the life-changing money I dreamed of. In some cases, I sold them just to avoid the renewal fee; others, I just let expire. 

After practicing minimalism, I’m fully sold on the idea that having less makes us happier.

### Digital Decluttering
*Goodbye, Things* by Fumio Sasaki was a life-changing read for me. I didn't just clear out my physical space; I wiped out my digital one, too. I started deleting social media accounts—of which I had plenty—and old email addresses. 

Surprisingly, the more I let go, the happier I became. Anyone who has decluttered knows the feeling: **nobody hates a clean space**, not even a lazy person who hates the act of cleaning itself.

### 2026: The Migration
Fast forward to today, and I’m reorganizing my digital footprint. I’ve deleted articles that no longer hold value and migrated the rest to this Jekyll theme Blog because the platform is **clean af**. 

I truly hope Herman keeps this running for a lifetime.
