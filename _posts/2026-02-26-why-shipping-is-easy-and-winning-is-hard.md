It’s never been easier to be a “founder.”

For the price of a decent lunch—about $20—you can buy the entire backbone of a tech empire. Hosting? Pennies. Authentication? Handled. Payments? Integrated. Analytics? Built in. You can spin up a vector database and deploy globally in an afternoon.

AI has effectively wiped out technical friction. The *how* is solved. It is now functionally impossible for a motivated person **not** to be able to start something online.

**Infrastructure has never been cheaper. But infra isn’t the hard part anymore.**

## The Illusion of Progress

We’ve mistaken *reduced friction* for *reduced difficulty*.

$20 buys you:

- Hosting & Auth  
- Payments & Analytics  
- Vector DB & Deployment  

It **doesn’t** buy you:

- Distribution  
- Retention  
- Differentiation  
- Trust  
- A Moat  

The cost to build is near zero. The cost to *matter* is unchanged.

If anything, the price of “mattering” has gone up—because the noise floor is now deafening.

## The Competition Paradox

We are living through a paradox:

> There has never been a cheaper time to ship, yet there has never been a more competitive time to win.

When everyone has the same $20 stack, the stack ceases to be an advantage.

When everyone can generate a clean UI and a functional backend with a few prompts, “having an app” is no longer a business—it’s a digital business card.

The technical friction is gone.  
The **market friction** remains.

## What Money Doesn’t Buy

**Trust** is the new currency.  
AI-generated everything has made us skeptical of anything.

**Differentiation** is the new struggle.  
When everyone uses the same LLMs to write their copy and code, everything starts to look like the same beige SaaS.

**Distribution** is the real moat.  
Because attention—not infrastructure—is scarce.

We’ve automated the building.  
We haven’t automated the soul.

## The New Hard Part

The hard part has moved upstream.

It’s no longer about whether your code scales.  
It’s about whether your message resonates.

It’s no longer about shipping fast.  
It’s about staying relevant.

The winners in this era won’t brag about their stack. Nobody cares that you’re “on the edge.” Infrastructure is table stakes.

Tell me why yours deserves my attention, when everyone can build the same thing for $20.

Tell me what you have that can’t be prompt-generated.

Tell me why you matter.
