Nutt (1981) · Bangkok, Thailand.

I started writing in 2020 to document my life — not for an audience, but for myself. Years later, I'm still here. Still reflecting. Still learning.

This blog is a deliberate migration. I'm moving my most meaningful work to this space — leaving behind the noise, keeping only what endures.

No algorithms to chase. No metrics to watch. Just writing that matters to me.
