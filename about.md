## New home. Old thoughts.

**The Evolution**\ 
In 2021, I started writing to document my life.  
In 2026, I am refining it.

**The Space**\ 
This site is a **curated migration**. I am intentionally moving my most meaningful work here, creating a faster and cleaner environment for my writing to live. 

No clutter. No lag. Just the thoughts that matter.

> **Status:** Migrating the archives. Building the future.
