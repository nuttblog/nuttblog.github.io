# Projects

A small collection of side projects I've built mostly to solve problems in my own life.  
They're simple tools, free to use, and still get occasional updates when I feel like tinkering.

### 1. OrganicBook.com
A curated collection of books on sustainable living, nature, food, health, and simple/organic lifestyles.  
I read a lot in these areas and wanted a quiet place to share honest reviews, ratings, and why certain books actually matter (instead of just another Amazon list).  

- Link: [organicbook.com](https://organicbook.com)  
- Built with: jekyll 
- Status: Actively adding new reviews when I finish good ones. Currently ~68 books reviewed across categories like Sustainability, Nature, Health & Nutrition, Food & Farming, and Simple Living.
  

### 2. MySat (mysat.lovable.app)
A real-time converter between Bitcoin (BTC), Satoshis (Sats), Thai Baht (THB), and US Dollars (USD).  
I built it because I often need to quickly check sats-to-baht or BTC-to-USD without opening heavy apps or exchanges. Updates every 30 seconds via CoinGecko API.

- Link: [mysat.lovable.app](https://mysat.lovable.app)  
- Built with: Lovable (no-code/low-code platform)  
- Status: Live and working. Interface is in Thai (since that's my daily use case), but the logic is straightforward.



### 3. 1080 Image Converter (nutt.cc/1080)
A dead-simple tool that takes any image (HEIC, WEBP, PNG, JPG, TIFF, AVIF, etc.) and converts/resizes it to JPEG at exactly 1080px width — the sweet spot for Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. without cropping or distortion.  
Supports drag-and-drop for multiple files. Built because I got tired of manually resizing photos every time I post.

- Link: [nutt.cc/1080](https://nutt.cc/1080)  
- Built with: JavaScript (client-side, probably with browser APIs or a lightweight library)  
- Status: Fully functional, free, no login required.

That's it for now. These are the ones I'm still maintaining or occasionally improving.  
If you're curious about any of them (tech stack, why I built it, lessons learned), feel free to ask — happy to write more or even turn one into a full blog post.
